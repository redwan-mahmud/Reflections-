When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

* When i will be required to collaborate with other people 
* and would want to share my projects online i need to create a 
* remote repository.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

* Much easier to keep track of the pull changes when I am doing it manually.
* Might not want all commits to be added to computer.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?

* Forks allow us to make a clone a file from github to our account. It is used when we 
  want to use the files instead of making changes to the original file cloned from. 

* Branches are used when we want to create new features but don't want to include it in our 
  main file yet. It is used when we want to keep working in the same repository and easily 
  merge features. 

* Clones is basically copying a version of the files to our computer.
  We use it when we want to work in our machine or just make a different copy of our file
  elsewhere.
