When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

* When i will be required to collaborate with other people 
* and would want to share my projects online i need to create a 
* remote repository.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

* Much easier to keep track of the pull changes when I am doing it manually.
* Might not want all commits to be added to computer.
