1st questions..

It helped me view if the lines in two code were differnt 
Helped track the changes made between the old and the new files 
Easy to keep track of changes 


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make 
you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It makes it easier to debug code..
If i added code that made the program to malfunction i can 
track back..


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing 
when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved,
 like Google Docs does?


 Much easier to track changes and keep track 


 Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving 
 multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat 
 each file separately?

 GIt is more programming oriented and hence one when we change one file 
 we usually need to change it to another
